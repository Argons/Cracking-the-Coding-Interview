// There is an 8x8 chess board in which two diagonally opposite corners have 
// been cut off. You are given 31 dominos, and a single domino can cover 
// exactly two squares. Can you use the 31 dominos to cover the entire board? 
// Prove your answer (by providing an example, or showing why itâ€™s impossible).
