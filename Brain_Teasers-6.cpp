// There are one hundred closed lockers in a hallway. A man begins by opening 
// all one hundred lockers. Next, he closes every second locker. Then he goes 
// to every third locker and closes it if it is open or opens it if it is 
// closed (e.g., he toggles every third locker). After his one hundredth pass 
// in the hallway, in which he toggles only locker number one hundred, how 
// many lockers are open?
